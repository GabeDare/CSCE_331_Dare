            <h2>Software Engineer Intern (May 2024 - Aug 2024)</h2>
            <p> 
                I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Raytheon Technologies on the 
                Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) Project. I developed a 
                program to test the accuracy of software actions and assist in future development. 
                When requested by the customer, I ensured that the program's code met the project 
                requirements by performing static code analysis across the entire codebase for our 
                project group. Through this analysis, I identified and resolved an issue with the 
                code output, which uncovered several previously hidden issues. The debugging I 
                performed improved the overall stability and usability of the project's code. 
                Additionally, when the customer raised concerns about the software's operability, 
                I drafted a report explaining why the program functioned as it did and how changes 
                could impact other areas of the project. I also aligned input data between different 
                software development teams to ensure proper functionality.

            <h2>Software Configuration Management Intern (May 2023 - Aug 2023)</h2>
            <p>
                During my previous internship at Raytheon Technologies, I worked as a 
                Software Configuration Management Intern, where I collaborated on various 
                projects to ensure a stable baseline for software requirements during the 
                development of new programs. I also contributed to the development process 
                by writing code for some of the programs I worked on. Additionally, I revised 
                and edited Version Description Documents (VDD) to ensure the stated updates 
                aligned with the actual changes, performed functional reviews for software 
                Change Notices (CNs), and worked on Supplier Statement of Work documents to 
                ensure their timely review. Furthermore, I contributed to the Configuration 
                and Data Management Plan for the APY-10 Radar System and developed a data 
                parsing program to enhance internal cybersecurity.

            <h2>Configuration and Data Management Intern (Jun 2022 - Aug 2022)</h2>
            <p>
                During my first internship at Raytheon Technologies, I worked as a Hardware 
                Configuration Management Intern. In this role, my primary responsibility was to 
                enable cost savings by eliminating part duplications, which ensured efficient 
                materials management. I also created Technical Data Packages for the Next Generation 
                Jammer (NGJ) project and managed document objects, gear parts, iteration requests, 
                and change requests for various projects.

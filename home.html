            <p>
                I am a Computer Engineering Major from Texas A&M. I've worked on many team 
                based projects for school as well as various groups in industry, so I think 
                that I would be able to fit into and contribute to just about any group! 
                Some of my interests include working with artificial intelligence / machine 
                learning and software development. As for my personal hobbies, I enjoy reading,
                playing videogames, and playing boardgames.
